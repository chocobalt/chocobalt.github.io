I'm Oliver Brandt, a journalistic researcher and audio engineer who currently resides in Hobart, Tasmania. This is my blog, it's not very good, but it's mine. 

### About me

After completing a Bachelor Degree in Journalism and a Bachelor Degree in Audio Engineering, I moved from the sweltering heat of Queensland to the frosty depths of Tasmania to be closer to family. I currently work as a journalistic researcher, with the occasional audio engineering job thrown in here and there to keep things interesting. I also like to fix things that are broken.

I'm 21 years old, bisexual and a feminist. My specialist areas include LGBT news and politics. I promise not to be upset if you disagree with me.
