title: The World is Scary, Let's Play Pokémon
---

###### by Oliver Brandt

As a journalistic researcher, I see a lot of shit that scares me. I like to think I'm strong enough to get through it all. I've gotten this far, right? I'm still standing. But the truth is, it gets to me. It hits me hard every time I sit at my desk and read something awful. It wears me down and sometimes, it's just too much. 

This past week has been fucking terrifying. I'll try to avoid getting too political, but the world is not in a good place. People are suffering. People will suffer more. And there's nothing anybody can do to stop it. Every morning, when I sit down at my desk, I dread turning on my PC, because I know there will be nothing but bad news to sort through. At the end of each day, I turn my PC off and just sit. I'm exhausted and tired, but most of all, I'm afraid. 

There's been one constant in my life for over fifteen years. When shit gets scary, play Pokémon. It's gotten me through more awful situations than I care to count. It's been my escape when there's no light at the end of the tunnel, and my saviour when suicidal thoughts crept in. Pokémon has been what's kept me going, all these years. Whenever I'm afraid, I boot up the latest game, and I just play. It doesn't matter what I do. I could be training, I could be hatching eggs, I could be searching for a rare creature. 

This week, I've spent a lot of time transferring my Pokémon from older games to Sun, just to test them out in the new Elite Four. It's boring and tedious, but every time I throw out a Pokémon of mine I've not seen in battle for years, I feel a little bit more okay. It's nothing special, it's no magical solution to my problems, but it leaves me feeling a tiny bit better than I was before. And that little bit is enough to keep me going. These Pokémon have been through as many battles as I have. We're in this together. These digital, make-belief creatures are my rock. 

So, if the world is scary for you, and I wouldn't blame you for being afraid, find something that gives you a little something to hold onto. Hatch an egg, catch a new creature, give it a silly nickname that you'll laugh at in three years time when you can't remember why you named it something so stupid. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it gets you to the end of the day. 

The world is scary, play Pokémon instead.
